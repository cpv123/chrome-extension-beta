Omnibox extension to help you go straight to a GitHub repository.

1. Save a target GitHub account - this could be a personal profile or organisation
2. Save a list of known repositories for this target account; you can update this list at any time

Activate the extension by typing "gh" followed by a space; you can then either

- Filter through your list of saved repositories
- Enter the exact name of a repository
- Immediately hit enter and go to the target GitHub account
